## How-To

For assignment 4, ensure Simio and and MySQL can talk to each other. Then, just adjust the MySQL parameters at the top of `main.R` and run all of it, except to note which of the two types of visualization (real-time or a replay) you'd like to run. Note that both are limited by the outputs of Simio into MySQL.
